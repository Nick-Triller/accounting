# Example transactions for a household

## Background

### Rule #1: Assets = Liabilities + Equity

This must always hold true after every double-entry.

### Rule #2: Debits, Credits and "T-charts"

A double-entry always has at least one debit and one credit.

A T-chart represents a single double-entry. 
A debit always goes 
on left side of the "T-chart" 
and credit goes
on the right.
[FreshBooks](https://www.freshbooks.com/hub/accounting/t-accounts)
defines a T-chart as
>
> the visual structure used in double entry bookkeeping to keep
> debits and credits separated. For example, on a T-chart, debits are listed
> to the left of the vertical line while credits are listed on the right side
> of the vertical line making the companyâ€™s general ledger easier to read.
>

Note that
in double-entry accounting,
a credit can both increase and 
decrease an account balance.
For example, 
when you credit your savings account
(an asset)
the balance goes down!
I have to use
the table in
the next section (Rule #3)
to consistently 
get the T-charts right.

### Rule #3: The five different types of accounts.

| Account     | Increased By | Decreased By | Examples                                     |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Assets      | Debit        | Credit       | cash, checking account, real estate          |
| Expenses    | Debit        | Credit       | food, entertainment, interest payments, etc. |
| Liabilities | Credit       | Debit        | mortgage principle, credit card balance      |
| Equity      | Credit       | Debit        | your net worth                               |
| Revenue     | Credit       | Debit        | paycheck, interest earned, bond dividends    |



## Example Transactions

### Example #1: A paycheck is deposited in your checking account.

```
 Debit                | Credit
----------------------+--------------
checking account      | income
```

* Your checking account balance increases.  A checking account 
  is an asset, 
  so read 
  the first row 
  in the rule #3 table.  To increase an asset account
  you debit it.
* Your paycheck income goes up.  Income is revenue,
  so read
  the fifth row
  in the rule #3 table. To increase a revenue account
  you credit it.


### Example #2: Your pay your monthly Netflix bill.
```
 Debit                | Credit
----------------------+--------------
 media expense        | checking account
```


* Your checking account balance decreases.
* Your media expense balance increases.

### Example #3: You pay your mortgage.
```
 Debit                | Credit
----------------------+--------------
 interest expense     | checking account
 principle still due  | checking account
```

* Interest on the mortgage is an expense, and it increases.
* The principle left on your mortgage is a liability, and it decreases.


### Example #4: The value of your house goes up.
```
 Debit                | Credit
----------------------+--------------
 house value          | equity
```

Businesses don't need 
to track this change
as it is an unrealized gain.

But a household may
want to track 
their current net worth.


### Example #5: Your 401k earns interest and dividends.
```
 Debit                | Credit
----------------------+--------------
 retirement accounts  | equity
```

See Example #4.

### Example #6: You want track taxes withheld from your paycheck an expense.


```
 Debit                | Credit
----------------------+--------------
 Federal tax expense  | Paycheck income
```

This one is tricky.
Why does income
(a revenue account)
also increase?
It is because your gross income
includes your tax withholding.

* Tax expense increases (debit)
* Gross paycheck income (revenue) increases (credit)

If you choose 
to track just your net income, 
you would use
the T-chart
in Example #1.


## Your Chart of Accounts

Your Chart of Accounts
is your 
personal set of account names.

The account names you pick
depends on what
financial questions
you want to answer.
For example,
if you want
to know your total income tax expense
you would need
at least one expense account
for income tax.
