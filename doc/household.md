# Example transactions for a household

## Background

### Rule #1: Assets = Liabilities + Equity

This must always hold true after a double-entry.

### Rule #2: Debits, Credits and "T Accounts"

Debit means on the left side of the "T account" and credit means on the right.

[FreshBooks](https://www.freshbooks.com/hub/accounting/t-accounts)
defines a T Account as
>
> the visual structure used in double entry bookkeeping to keep 
> debits and credits separated. For example, on a T-chart, debits are listed 
> to the left of the vertical line while credits are listed on the right side 
> of the vertical line making the companyâ€™s general ledger easier to read.

### Rule #3: The five different types of accounts.

| Account     | Increased By | Decreased By | Examples                                       |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Assets      | Debit        | Credit       | Cash, Accounts Receivable, Supplies, Equipment |
| Expenses    | Debit        | Credit       | Food, Media, Interest payments, Insurance      |
| Liabilities | Credit       | Debit        | Mortgage, Accounts Payable, Wages Payable      |
| Equity      | Credit       | Debit        | Increased home value                           |
| Revenue     | Credit       | Debit        | Paycheck                                       |



## Example Transactions

### Example #1: Your paycheck is deposited in your checking account.

```
 Debit                | Credit
----------------------+--------------
checking account      | income
```

* Your checking account is an asset and it increases.
* Your paycheck is revenue, and it also increases.


### Example #2: Your pay your monthly Netflix bill.
```
 Debit                | Credit
----------------------+--------------
 media expenses       | checking account
```


* Your checking account decreases.
* Your media expenses increase (if you track to that level of detail).

### Example #3: You pay your mortgage.
```
 Debit                | Credit
----------------------+--------------
 interest expense     | checking account
 principle still due  | checking account
```

* Interest on the mortgage is an expense, and it increases.
* The principle left on your mortgage is a liability, and it reduces.


### Example #4: The value of your house goes up.
```
 Debit                | Credit
----------------------+--------------
 house value          | equity
```

You don't need to account for this for tax purposes, but you may want to 
track it.  Both things go up, your net worth and your asset balance.


### Example #5: Your 401k earns interest and dividends.
```
 Debit                | Credit
----------------------+--------------
 retirement accounts  | equity
```

This is very similar to example 4.

### Example #6: You want track taxes withheld from your paycheck an expense.

Tricky: 

* Tax expense increases (debit)
* Gross paycheck income (revenue) increases (credit)

Your gross income includes your tax witholdings.

You could also choose to track your net income, in which case you just use
the T Account in Example #1.


```
 Debit                | Credit
----------------------+--------------
 Federal tax expense  | Paycheck income
```

This is very similar to example 4.

## A note on account names

Your "Chart of Accounts"
is your set of account names.

Which account names you use depend on 
how detailed you want your records.
While keeping a lot of detail
is a good idea,
it also means
you have a lot more choices
about what accounts to use
in the T Account.

The level of detail
really depends on what
financial question
or questions
you want to answer.
